        <h1>Programming Languages Classification</h1>
        <p>This website categorizes programming languages into various classifications based on their nature and usage. Compiled languages are transformed into machine code before execution. Interpreted languages are executed line by line by an interpreter. Scripted languages are used to automate tasks and can be embedded within other programs. Markup languages are used to define the structure and presentation of text. Object-oriented languages are based on the concept of objects and classes. Query languages are designed to make queries in databases and information systems. Explore each category to learn more about specific programming languages!</p>
