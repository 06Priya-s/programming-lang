        <h1>Scripted Languages</h1>
        <p>Scripted languages are used to automate tasks and are often embedded within other programs. They can be interpreted or compiled and are typically easy to learn and use. Bash is a Unix shell and command language used for scripting on Unix and Unix-like systems. Lua is a lightweight, high-level programming language designed for embedded use in applications. Perl is a high-level, general-purpose language known for its text-processing capabilities. JavaScript is also commonly used for scripting, especially in web development.</p>
